[Intro]
Give me your hands
Show me the door
I cannot stand
To wait anymore
Somebody said
Be what you’ll be
We could be old and cold and dead on the sea

[Chorus]
But I love you more than words can say
I can’t count the reasons I should stay

[Verse 1]
Give me some rope
Tie me to dream
Give me the hope to run out of steam
Somebody said it can be here
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year

[Chorus]
I can’t count the reasons I should stay
One by one they all just fade away

[Bridge]
Iʼm tired of the wait-and-sees
Iʼm tired of that part of me
That makes up a perfect lie
To keep us between
But hours turn into days
So watch what you throw away
And be here to recognize
Thereʼs another way

adding sth
